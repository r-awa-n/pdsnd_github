### Project Title  
Explore US Bikeshare Data with Python

### Description  
This project explores data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington—using Python. The project uses data from CSV files and allows users to filter data by city, month, and day to view different insights such as:
- Most common times of travel
- Popular stations and trips
- Trip duration statistics
- User demographics

The project is completed as part of the Udacity **Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree**.

### Files Used  
- `bikesharerawan.py` – the main Python script that contains the project code  
- `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv` – datasets used for analysis  
- `.gitignore` – modified to exclude unnecessary files  
- `README.md` – project documentation

### Credits  
- Project framework and datasets provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
- Inspired by examples and best practices from the Udacity forums and documentation
